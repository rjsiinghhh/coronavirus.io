# coronavirus.github.io



My project... It's a simple idea, to give an accurate count of the coronavirus cases and casualties based upon the location you feed the search. I added three modals. One giving basic symptom information, another with a general warning if your feeling sick, and the last modal has a documentary along with a symptoms video. The toughest part of this project was dealing with the api. It was different from the example api we used in class, and with that it took a long time to understand how to work with it. It took me a few days to figure out how fix the case sensitivity on the search function. I added "toLowerCase" and "trim" to help with that. Fun stuff, fun stuff. My page was made to be simple. Solely function over flash. I would add a lot more to this project, but not on the page itself, but in functionality. What it can do for the user. For one, I want this to be an app. In a crazy world, maybe it can send alerts to people who are within a certain radius of someone who tested positive for covid, anonymously. Granted that would need access to test results and would've needed to be started 6 months ago.
