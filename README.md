My project... It's a simple idea, to give an accurate count of the coronavirus cases and casualties based upon the location you feed the search. I added two modals, one giving basic symptom information and another with a general warning if your feeling sick. The toughest part of this project was dealing with the api. It was different from the example api we used in class, and with that it took a long time to understand how to work with it. My page was made to be simple. Nothing flashy, the google homepage was stuck in my mind during the project, function over flash. I would add a lot more to this project if I had the chance and the know how. For one, I want this to be an app. In a crazy world, maybe it can send alerts to people who are within a certain radius of someone who tested positive for covid, anonymously. Granted that would need access to test results and would've needed to be start 6 months ago.
